Large Language Models use techniques from deep learning, particularly transformer architectures, to process and produce language in a way that can mimic human writing styles, answer questions, summarize texts, translate languages, and more.\n\nExamples of Large Language Models include OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, such as GPT-3, which are widely known for their ability to handle a diverse range of language-based tasks with high levels of proficiency. These models are pivotal in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and are continually evolving to handle more complex language tasks and ethical considerations in AI applications.",
