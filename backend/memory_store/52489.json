I am writing to formally request leave of absence from school for two days, on [specific dates], due to [brief reason, e.g., a family commitment, personal reasons, etc.].

Please let me know if I need to complete any formal procedures or provide additional documentation to facilitate this request.\n\nThank you very much for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding and support.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Grade/Class]  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust the specific dates, reason for the leave, and any other personal details as necessary.",
